This tool also works on termux as expected since it is based on bash (i do aim for cross platform üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚úÖ) , but i assume and expect limited functionality , your more than welcome to pull a issue request regarding os & or function and i will try my best to get back to you & or update the tool if there is enough interest.
